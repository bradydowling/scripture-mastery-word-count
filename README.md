### Background

This package contains a script that will run a wordcount on a list of scriptures. I specifically care about the New Testament scripture mastery scriptures (in the gospels) this year as that is what my seminary students are focused on at the time of this writing.

This should work for any scripture mastery or any scripture in general though.


### Output Snapshot

This section will quickly become out of sync with the script but for many people a snapshot of the output (even if it doesn't perfectly match the script) will be all you need so I'm including it here.
